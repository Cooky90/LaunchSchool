KEY NOTES

## New variables are not reassigning anything so there is no new object id!!

#???^^ Ruby reuses object id anlthough object different.

# Any objects created in a block cannot be accessible outwards of that block scope.

# Take time to go over it again and try to guess each stage.

# REPETITION!!!!!!

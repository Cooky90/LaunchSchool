# There are differences between the two buffer methods. The first method uses the '<<' operator
# and mutates the buffer variable. The second method uses the '+' operator assigns the two elements to a variable.
# The second method will not mutate the buffer variable.

# Note: Better wording is , the method will alter the caller's input array in the first method.

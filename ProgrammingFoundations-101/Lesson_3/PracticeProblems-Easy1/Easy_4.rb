# The following methods delete(1) and delete_at(1) both do different things,
# with an array of numbers #delete would delete any occurances of the
# number '1'. 

# #delete_at deletes an element at the specified location, i.e. if the
# argument passed to the method is (1) then it will delete the second
# element in the array.

# WORTH NOTING: The method names do not follow with an '!' sign, yet 
# they are destuctive methods as the return the same array after
# mutating it. NOT ALL DESTRUCTIVE METHODS FOLLOW WITH A '!'
